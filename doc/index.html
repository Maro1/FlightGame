    <h1>Computer Graphics Project Report</h1>
    <h4>by Mathias RÃ¸nning</h4>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive 3D-app using HTML5, CSS and WebGL.
            My choice of app is a 3D flight game, where the player controls an airplane flying over an
            island in the ocean. The player is able to control the airplane's roll, pitch and speed, and
            there are several provided controls to change parameters of the environment like fog, lighting
            and camera. An in-game image is shown below.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            The application has been tested both on Linux and Windows with the browsers Firefox and Chrome.
            In addition, some touch controls are provided on mobile platforms to control the plane.
        </p>

        <h2>The Classes</h2>
        <p>
            The project has several classes to abstract away common functionality to avoid code
            duplication. The main classes are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="class-name">Mesh</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Texture</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Model</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Actor</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Airplane</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Camera</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Skybox</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">ShadowMap</span></li>
            <li><span class="class-name">Scene</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mesh</h3>
        <p>
            The meshes are handled in the class <span class="class-name">Mesh</span> in <b>mesh.js</b>.
            All of the meshes are loaded from an OBJ file using the <b>glm_utils.js</b> library provided
            during class. The mesh data is then processed including vertex positions, texture coordinates,
            normals, tangents and bitangents. Each of these are contained in a separate WebGL buffer, and
            the data is uploaded using <code>gl.bufferData</code> for each buffer. The meshes are drawn
            in the <code>draw()</code> function of the <span class="class-name">Mesh</span> class, using
            <code>gl.vertexAttribArray</code> and <code>gl.vertexAttribPointer</code> to specify where the
            vertex data should go and of which format it is for the vertex shader. The function ends with a
            <code>gl.drawArrays</code> call to draw the vertices of the mesh.
        </p>
        <h3>Texture</h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="class-name">Texture</span> class in <b>texture.js</b> contains the code for
            loading a texture from an image file. Upon construction a WebGL texture is created and initially
            set to black using <code>gl.texImage2D</code>, before loading the image and specifying that as
            the texture and generating mipmaps.
        </p>
        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="class-name">Model</span> class in <b>mesh.js</b> binds together a single mesh
            with several textures. Each <span class="class-name">Model</span> has a diffuse, specular and
            normal texture. The effects of these are further discussed in the "Lighting and Advanced Rendering"
            section.
        </p>
        <h3>Actor</h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="class-name">Actor</span> class in <b>mesh.js</b> is the main class for objects
            in the scene, and can contain a model or not. The class contains a <code>transform</code> field,
            which is used to transform the object from object space to world space and is the <code>model</code>
            matrix of the vertex shader. In addition the actor class provides possibility for a hierarchy, where
            each level of the hierarchy tree applies its transform.
        </p>
        <h3>Airplane</h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="class-name">Airplane</span> class in <b>airplane.js</b> is the class containing
            the airplane logic. It contains two actors; the plane and the propeller, where the propeller is a
            child of the plane in the actor hierarchy. Each tick the plane transform is updated with regards to
            user input (further discussed in "Controls and Input") and its speed, and the propeller is rotated
            with regards to the speed.
        </p>
        <h3>Camera</h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="class-name">Camera</span> class in <b>camera.js</b> extends the
            <span class="class-name">Actor</span> class and contains the camera logic. The
            camera instance is a child of the plane actor as to follow the plane. The class
            has functions for calculating the <code>view</code> and <code>projection</code>
            matrices, where <code>view</code> is calculated from the inverse of the camera
            transform and <code>projection</code> is calculated using the <b>m4.js</b> library
            perspective projection function.
        </p>
        <h3>Scene</h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="class-name">Scene</span> class in <b>scene.js</b> contains the code
            for updating and rendering all the actors in the scene, also updating the common uniforms
            among all objects such as light position and camera matrices.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Controls and User Input</h2>
        <p>
            The application has input controls for controlling various aspects of the application. The
            airplane can be controlled using the WASD keys, where W and S controls the pitch, and A and D
            the roll. This is done by checking for keys pressed each tick and updating the rotation of the
            airplane actor accordingly (<code>update</code> function of <b>airplane.js</b>). There is an amortization
            constant multiplied with the speed when no input is provided to make the rotation come to a stop smoothly
            and not instantly. On mobile an alternative input scheme is provided, where touching the sides of the
            screen rotates the plane in that direction (right and left sides control roll and up and down pitch).
            This is implemented in the <code>touch*</code> functions in <b>main.js</b> The + and - keys can be used 
            to control the airplane speed, where the airplane is translated along is direction depending on the speed. 
            In addition, the camera angle can be adjusted according to pre-defined presets by pressing the C key, 
            changing the camera transform matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application also contains a GUI for adjusting various aspects of the environment as seen in Figure 2. 
            This includes light parameters as well as toggling the advanced rendering techniques. In addition there 
            is a "Orbit Mode" toggle that, upon toggling, changes the input scheme. When enabled, the mouse (or touch on mobile) 
            controls the camera in an orbit fashion around the world Y axis, with the airplane as the orbit center. While in orbit 
            mode, the camera view matrix is calculated from an angle and distance (<code>viewMatrix()</code> in <b>camera.js</b>)
            instead of the camera transform to make the orbit calculation simpler.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Lighting and Advanced Rendering</h2>
        <p>
            The scene contains a single directional light for lighting the scene in addition to using environment mapping 
            with a skybox for the specular component. In addition some more advanced rendering techniques have been 
            implemented incluing shadows, normal mapping and fog. The main object lighting calculation is done in the 
            <code>fragment-shader</code> script in <b>index.html</b>, being a GLSL shader.
        </p>
        <h3>Directional Lighting</h3>
        <p>
            The directional light has a direction, color and intensity controllable from the GUI. The direction is given 
            as the direction from the origin to the lighting instead of the other way around since this vector is used for 
            the diffuse calculation. For each object, the lighting calculation is based on the Phong model, having an ambient, 
            diffuse and specular component. The color of the object is taken from its diffuse texture map. This is multiplied 
            by a constant to provide the ambient component. For the diffuse component, the color is multiplied by the dot product 
            between the light direction and the surface normal, since larger angles should give lower diffuse (and maxed with 0 
            to avoid negative values). This is then multiplied by the light color and intensity. 
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/3.png" width="40%">
            <figcaption>Figure 3: The airplane diffuse texture.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            For the specular component, the specular texture is used for the object value instead of the diffuse texture, 
            where the specular texture is a grayscale texture where higher values means higher specular and lower values lower 
            specular. This means the specular can vary on an object, giving a better result on objects with many "materials" such as 
            the airplane (glass, metal, paint). The specular component is calculated by multiplying by the dot product between the 
            surface viewing direction and the surface light reflection direction, since when these two vectors coincide the specular 
            highlight should be higher. By raising this value to a power the size of the specular highlight can be changed (where higher 
            values give smaller highlights and make the object look "shinier"). For this project the dot product is raised to the constant 
            power of 16, since textures are used instead of for example OBJ materials. The specular is then multiplied by light color 
            and intensity, in addition to a reflection component based on skybox environment mapping.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Skybox and Environment Mapping</h3>
        <p>
            The scene contains a skybox drawn from a cubemap texture containing 6
            different textures as shown in figure 5, where each texture corresponds
            to a different face direction. The cubemap texture is set up in the 
            <span class="class-name">Skybox</span> class in <b>texture.js</b>. In
            the <code>#init()</code> function all the 6 texture images are 
            loaded and stored as the correct cubemap texture using <code>gl.texImage2D</code>
            and mipmaps are generated. Following this, a vertex buffer containing the 
            positions of a quad filling the whole canvas is set up to draw the cubemap
            onto.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/5.png" width="100%">
            <figcaption>Figure 5: The cubemap textures.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The skybox is drawn in the <code>draw()</code> function of the 
            <span class="class-name">Skybox</span> class. This uses the shaders 
            <code>skybox-vs</code> and <code>skybox-fs</code> from <b>index.html</b>.
            The depth function is set to <code>gl.LEQUAL</code> before drawing since
            the Z values of the quad vertices are all set to 1.0 (as to draw them 
            behind everything else). The inverse of the <code>projection * view</code>
            matrix with 0 translation is sent to the fragment shader as a uniform. 
            This matrix is then used to sample from the cubemap, by multiplying it 
            with the fragment position to go from screen space to world space (since 
            fragment positions are in screen space).
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to drawing the skybox, the cubemap texture is used for 
            environment mapping. In the main fragment shader <code>fragment-shader</code>
            used for the objects, the specular component has a term consisting of the 
            cubemap sample from the reflection of the viewing direction along the normal,
            creating a reflection effect.
        </p>
        <h3>Shadows</h3>
        <p>
            The airplane model of the scene is the only objects that casts shadows.
            The reasoning behind this is that the scene is very large, and that the 
            camera always follows the airplane. Because the scene is large, either multiplie
            shadow maps or a <b>very</b> high resolution one would have to be used to cast
            shadows on the whole scene with decent results. Instead, since there is only
            a single directional light, the position of the "light camera" creating the 
            shadow map is calculated by going in the light direction from the airplane position 
            (see <code>update()</code> in <b>scene.js</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The shadow map is created in the <code>#init()</code> function in the 
            <span class="class-name">ShadowMap</span> class in <b>texture.js</b>.
            This creates a separate framebuffer and sets up a depth texture which the
            uses as a depth attachment, such that when the framebuffer is drawn to, the
            depth component is stored to the texture. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When drawing the scene in the <code>draw()</code> function in <b>scene.js</b>,
            the scene is drawn twice, the first being to the shadow map. During the shadow 
            map draw call, the culling is set to the front faces to minimize the offset created
            by the bias (which is discussed in the following paragraph). The draw call uses 
            separate shaders, <code>shadow-vs</code> and <code>shadow-fs</code>, where the 
            fragment shader is just used to avoid warnings (since only depth component is 
            of interest). The vertex shader contains the <code>lightSpaceMatrix</code> uniform
            which transforms from world space to the light space using an orthographic projection
            (being a directional light).
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/6.png" width="50%">
            <figcaption>Figure 6: The airplane with its shadow.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            During the second draw call that actually draws the objects, the shadow map depth
            texture is used (assuming shadows are enabled). In the <code>fragment-shader</code>
            shader, this texture is used to calculate whether a fragment is in shadow in the
            <code>shadow()</code> function. This checks whether the depth of the 
            fragment from the shadow map (which is either the fragment depth or a blocking 
            fragments depth) is less than the current fragment depth. If it is, the fragment
            is in shadow and 0.0 is returned. A very small bias is added to avoid black lines
            as a result of multiple fragments sampling the same shadow map value. This has 
            the small disadvantage of offseting the shadow by a small amount.
        </p>
        <h3>Normal Mapping</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to the diffuse and specular textures, each object also has a
            normal map texture. This texture provides the normal for the fragments, 
            where r, g and b correspond to x, y, z of the normal vector. However, since
            this normal is relative to the normal of the face, it has to be transformed 
            from the tangent space of the face to world space. This is done through the 
            TBN matrix, consisting of a normal, tangent and bitangent vector, that are 
            perpendicular and form a basis for the tangent space. The normal is provided 
            by the <b>glmUtils.js</b> library, however the tangent and bitangent are 
            calculated in the <code>#initMesh()</code> function of <span class="class-name">Mesh</span>. 
            Once these are calculated, the TBN matrix can be calculated in the vertex shader by providing 
            the unit vectors as colums of the matrix. In the fragment shader, the normal can then be 
            calculated by sampling from the normal map and then multipying by the TBN matrix to provide
            the correct normal in world space. The normal is multiplied by 2 and subtracted 1 since
            the normalMap is in [0, 1] while the normal vector should be in [-1, 1].
        </p>

            <figcaption>Figure 7: The landscape normal map.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Fog</h3>
        <p>
            The fog effect is created by mixing the fragment color with a fog color based on
            the distance to the fragment. For the mesh objects, this is done in <code>fragment-shader</code>
            using the <code>smoothstep</code> function to interpolate between two values based on the distance.
            Since the skybox is not a mesh but still needs a fog effect for the fog to look convincing, the
            <code>skybox-fs</code> shader mixes the fog color based on the Y-coordinate of the inverted 
            <code>projection * view</code> matrix such that the fog is stronger when Y is closer to 0.

        <h2>Model/Texture Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The models and textures used are sourced from various sites online, where some have been slightly
            modified by for example adjusting the levels on textures. In addition, the airplane was originally
            a single mesh. but was separated using Blender.
